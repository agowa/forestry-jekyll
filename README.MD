# Forestry-Jekyll

This docker image provides a basic building environment for creating jekyll
based webpages within forestry, gitlab-ci and from interactive vs code
sessions.

This image is based upon the devcontainer provided by Microsoft.

It has been extended to also work within restrictive CI environments.
